# Colour-Memory

Colour Memory is a little game app, where you need to match cards with same colours. 

i.e
Select a card and try to match the colour with another card. You make +2 points every match, and -1 if you miss.

# Description

The main purpose of doing this app, was playing around with Autolayouts/Storyboards and multiples views inside one view controller and see how they behave and interact between each other and try full compatibility across all devices and rotation supported. That's why the most important component in the app are UIViews instead of using Collection View, which would be more easy to implement and manipulate.
